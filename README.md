MCMUCH Server (Ruby)
====================

This is the server for MCMUCH, written in Ruby.
The original idea was to use Node.js, but we got stuck in callback hell.

Why Ruby?
---------
Because it can get decent performance, and everyone who I've talked to about this know or are willing to learn Ruby.
